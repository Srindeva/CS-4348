In this session I want to define and implement all of the modules required to create the user interface for the project. 
First, I want to create a menu and file management class that will display the interface and have functions to detect errors when a certain user input is given.
After I want to refactor the B-tree implementation I've created before-hand to work with the specifications for our project (minimal degree = 10).

I created the basic skeletons of each of the classes required for managing the files and running the menu. 
Next session I want to implement the handle functions in Menu and start creating interactions between Meny and IDXFile.
